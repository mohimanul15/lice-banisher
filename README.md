Lice Banishers is a premium, service-oriented React landing page designed specifically for the New York City market. The project shifts the traditional medical aesthetic of lice removal toward a "Medical Boutique" and "Pure Delight" experience, focusing on high-conversion elements and emotional relief for stressed parents.
